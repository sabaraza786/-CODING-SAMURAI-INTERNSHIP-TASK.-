# -CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK.-
**Project 1 : Simple Calculator
**
Description: Build a basic calculator in C++ that can perform
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.
• Skills: Basic syntax, user input, conditional statements.

# 🔢 Simple C++ Calculator

> 💻 Perform basic arithmetic operations in the terminal!

## ✨ Features
- Handles: **Addition (+)**, **Subtraction (-)**, **Multiplication (*)**, **Division (/)**, and **Modulus (%)**
- 🧠 Uses `switch-case` for clean operator logic
- ✅ Prevents divide-by-zero and modulus-by-zero using `fmod()` from `<math.h>`
- 📌 Supports floating-point numbers (`double`)

## 🚀 How to Run

g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator

Project 2: Number Guessing Game

• Description: Develop a number guessing game where the
program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it.
• Skills: Loops, random number generation, condition checking.

# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (C++)

> 🔢 Guess a number between 1 and 100 — how close can you get?

## 🛠 Features
- 🎲 Random number generated using `rand()` seeded by `srand(time(0))`
- 🔁 Loop continues until the correct number is guessed
- 🧠 Logic handles higher/lower hints to guide the player

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
g++ number_guess.cpp -o guess
./guess
